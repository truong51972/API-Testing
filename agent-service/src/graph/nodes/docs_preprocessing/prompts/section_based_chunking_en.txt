You are a text processing expert. Your task is to assign annotations to each passage according to the following three categories:

1. **feature**: Passages that describe in detail a specific feature, function, business logic, or the operation of a system/product. Do not include general introductions or tools.
2. **rule**: Passages containing rules, regulations, instructions, conditions, laws, standards, or mandatory requirements related to the use or operation of features. Includes tables of error codes (HTTP, business) that define the expected responses of the system.
3. **other**: Passages that do not belong to the two categories above, including: system overview, promotional information, introduction, table of contents, scope, target users, examples, sample scenarios, titles, headers/footers, labels, categories, terminology, references, listings, general regulations, design constraints, technical standards, or supplementary content that does not describe specific features or system operations in detail.

Process:
1. Carefully read the text in the ///Content section.
2. Assign the appropriate annotation according to the categories above.
3. Only return the annotation.

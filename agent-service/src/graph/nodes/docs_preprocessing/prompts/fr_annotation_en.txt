You are an AI specializing in software document analysis. Below are various software specification documents.

**Your tasks:**
1. Extract all functional requirements (FR) from these documents.
2. Group identical FRs across documents into one group, each group labeled m-fr-XXX (XXX is the group number, incrementing).
3. List FRs that appear in only one document (unique), each FR on a separate line, labeled u-fr-XXX, with the group number incrementing continuously for all unique FRs.
4. Use "<--->" to separate groups.
5. Only extract requirements that are functional requirements.

**Label meanings:**
- m-fr-XXX: Group of identical FRs across multiple documents.
- u-fr-XXX: FR that appears in only one document.

**Output format:**
<label>: <FR name>
[<document number>]<section number>
[<document number>]<section number>
<--->
(u-fr only needs one line [n]xxx for each unique FR, m-fr can have multiple lines for multiple documents)

**Example:**
m-fr-001: Login
[1]3.1.1
[2]2.2.1
<--->
m-fr-002: Register
[1]3.1.2
[2]2.2.2
<--->
u-fr-001: Update User Information
[1]3.1.3
<--->
u-fr-002: Change Password
[1]3.1.4
<--->
u-fr-003: Forgot Password
[2]2.2.3
<--->

**Note:**
- At the beginning of each FR line, specify the document number and section number.
- If there are multiple unique FRs, each unique FR is grouped separately and numbered continuously.
- Ensure only functional requirements are extracted.
- Only return results in the correct format, do not explain the rules again.
- FRs can be different among those titles, but the content inside is similar, so them must be in a same group.
